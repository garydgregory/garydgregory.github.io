*Java Persistence with Hibernate, Second Edition* explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate, working through mappings, queries, fetching strategies, transactions, conversations, caching, and more. Along the way you'll find a well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design and optimization techniques. In this revised edition, authors Christian Bauer, Gavin King, and Gary Gregory cover Hibernate 5 in detail with the Java Persistence 2.1 standard (JSR 338). All examples have been updated for the latest Hibernate and Java EE specification versions.

*JUnit in Action, Second Edition* is an entirely revised and up-to-date guide to unit testing Java applications. It provides techniques for solving real-world problems such as using mocks for testing isolation, in-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and test automation. In an example-driven style, it covers JUnit 4.8 innovations such as the new annotations that simplify test writing, improved exception handling, and the new assertion methods. Along the way, you'll learn to integrate JUnit with other important open source frameworks and tools.

A [third](https://www.manning.com/books/junit-in-action-third-edition) edition is available, which includes the previous edition.
